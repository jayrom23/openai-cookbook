Summerdays Festival (EN)
In addition to a very special programming mix –classic rock acts on Friday, pop and Swiss stars on Saturday – the SummerDays Festival is renowned for its idyllic location in Arbon directly on the shores of Lake Constance.
The secret of the SummerDays ambiance is its unique blend of open-air festival and fun fair, and the programming line-up attracts friends and families alike. The affectionately arranged food festival and the beautiful landscape design and lighting make SummerDays an exceptional experience.
The SummerDays Festival in Arbon shares the weekend with its partner event, the Seaside Festival in Spiez. Both festivals are famous for their unique locations directly on a lake shore and benefit greatly from booking synergies. That’s why the line-up of the Seaside Festival includes artists that perform in Arbon as well, and vice versa.
