OpenAir St.Gallen (EN)
Four days of music, freedom, and celebration with over 60 live acts and 40 DJs on six different stages – all in front of a unique backdrop in the Sittertobel.
Since 1977, the OpenAir St. Gallen has been an inimitable member of the European festival scene: its location in a nature reserve close to the city, its always up-to-date musical line-up, and its faithful audience make it a very exceptional festival indeed. Every year, a small temporary town is constructed in the unspoiled countryside – a pioneering effort in terms of true sustainability that has since set the standard in terms of ecology, transparency, and communication.
The ambiance in the Sittertobel is legendary. The camping area and the concert grounds together form a greater whole: festival visitors can relax by their tents and roast their dinner on the fire while listening to the bands – Woodstock memories guaranteed! The Sitterbühne is the stage for Swiss and international headliners while the Sternenbühne showcases strong, young bands and the Intro stage offers a venue for potential stars of the future.
In the Plaza Quarter, creativity meets internationality. Numerous street-food booths entice festival visitors to discover culinary treasures, while the cosy, small Campfire stage invites people to grill their dinner in a musical atmosphere provided by up-and-coming singer-songwriters.
