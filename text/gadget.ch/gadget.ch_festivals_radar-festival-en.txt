Radar Festival (EN)
The Radar Festival is a one-day music festival that takes place once a year around the Langstrasse in Zurich, presenting the most promising Swiss and international newcomers in a variety of genres.
Several clubs and locations – all within walking distance from one another – invite the audience to discover up and coming artists and their live shows on various stages within the Langstrasse neighbourhood. The festival was launched in 2018 and has been a sell-out success ever since.
