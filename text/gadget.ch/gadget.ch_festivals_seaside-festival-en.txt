Seaside Festival (EN)
Since 2017, the Seaside Festival has been taking place in late summer in most beautiful bay of Europe. In the midst of vineyards, festival visitors enjoy a unique view of Spiez castle, the lake, and a majestic mountain panorama. This is why the Seaside Festival is known as a true gem among festivals, inviting visitors to slow down, relax, and simply enjoy.
This musical line-up concentrates on pop and rock, creating a cross-generational musical experience and unforgettable concerts in an idyllic atmosphere. Not only does the festival offer good music, but also lots of room to spend time with friends and family. The multi-faceted range of food and beverages and the beautiful decoration with lots of attention to detail make the Seaside Festival an unforgettable event.
The Seaside Festival in Spiez shares the weekend with its partner event, the SummerDays Festival in Arbon. Both festivals are famous for their unique locations directly on a lake shore and benefit greatly from booking synergies. That is why the line-up of the SummerDays Festival includes artists that perform in Spiez as well, and vice versa.
